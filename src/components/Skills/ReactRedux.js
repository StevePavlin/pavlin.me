import React from 'react';
import { Progress } from "./Progress";

export const ReactRedux = props => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Progress width={75}/>

        After spending the summer of 2016 trying angular 2 in release candidate stage, I decided
        I wanted to try React.
        <br />
        <br />
        ... I haven't built a frontend using another framework since.

        Libraries used:

        <ul className="bullets">
          <li>
            <span>
              <a target="_blank" href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> â€“ State management
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    </div>
  )
};
